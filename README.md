<h1>About AlphaWave Cipher</h1>
 
<h6 align="left">A Unique Dynamic Wave Pattern Cipher</h6>

<h6 align="left">Concept<h6 align="left">
The AlphaWave Cipher is a substitution cipher that uses the positional properties of letters in the alphabet to create a dynamic wave pattern for encryption...

<p align="left">Encryption Process</p><br/>
<p align="left">
Wave Amplitude Setup: The cipher begins with a predefined amplitude sequence, such as +3, -2, +1, -4, and repeats it for the length of the message</p>
<p align="left">
Letter Positioning: Each letter in the plaintext is assigned a number according to its position in the alphabet (A=1, B=2, C=3, ..., Z=26)</p>
<p align="left">
Shifting Process: The letter is shifted according to the wave amplitude corresponding to its position in the message.</p>
<p align="left">
Dynamic Adjustment: After each letter is encrypted, the amplitude can be adjusted based on a rule, adding an additional layer of complexity.</p>
<p align="left">
Repetition of Amplitude: The amplitude pattern repeats throughout the message, creating a wave-like effect that ensures no two identical letters are encrypted the same way.</p>

Example
Amplitude Sequence: +3, -2, +1, -4

Plaintext: "HELLO"

Ciphertext: "KCMHR"
</p>
Decryption Process
The decryption process is the reverse of encryption, using the same amplitude sequence to shift the letters back to their original positions.

Unique Features
Dynamic and Repeating Pattern: The use of a repeating amplitude sequence adds complexity and ensures the same letter can be encoded differently depending on its position.
Customizable Rules: The amplitude sequence can be customized or altered mid-message for added security.
Positional Sensitivity: The cipher is sensitive to the position of each letter, creating a non-linear and dynamic encryption pattern.
This cipher can be further expanded by incorporating multiple amplitude sequences, varying wrap-around rules, or even combining with other cipher techniques for enhanced security.
